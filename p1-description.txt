Question:

Write a console application in C or C++ that will read a stream of numbers from
stdin and, at each step, print the median of all numbers encountered so far and
the tenth smallest number encountered.

We're particularly interested in the design and clarity of the algorithm and
data structures (such that part of the problem could be changed without having
to rewrite unaffected parts) and the speed of the algorithm (how long it
would take to process 10 million inputs, for instance).

Please do not use the STL or any other external libraries in your solution.
Please do time your solution and how us how you measured the speed.


My solution notes:

Performance was measured with rtdscp, callgrind, and the time command.  I
answered using a simple array based heap.  There are more exotic heaps I could
have used but I only have so much time to spend on these things.
